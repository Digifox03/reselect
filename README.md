# Reselect

Reselect is a fabric library mod to enable players and modpack creators
to customize minecraft behaviour with as little coding knowledge as
necessary.

This mod provides the Reselect language, which allows the user to write
predicates that match entities based on various parameters such as the mob age,
current biome, name, health and other properties.

## Current status of the mod

This mod is temporarily replacing Varied Mob Textures until integration is
implemented.

The mod is in Alpha stage, and for testing purposes, it also contains features
that should be split off into another mod [Varied Mobs Textures].

The extra features provided are the ability to use Reselect scripts in resource
packs to have multiple textures for the same mob.

## How to use

### For users
if a resource pack requires this mod, just install it.
No configuration is required.

### For resource pack developers
The documentation isn't ready yet,
for help to make resource packs with this mod join the [Discord Server].

### For other mod creators
Currently the integration support is not complete,
if you wish to help contact me on the [Discord Server].
You may also wish to use the [VS Code plugin] for the Reselect language support.
